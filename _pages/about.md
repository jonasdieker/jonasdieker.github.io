My primary interests lie broadly in computer vision and robotics. Currently I am actively looking for Data Science and ML Engineer positions in Europe!

I recently completed an M.Sc. in Robotics & AI from TU Munich. For my master's thesis, which I conducted at UC Berkeley, I researched generative models for simulation of ocean currents.

Prior to this I received a M.Eng. from the University of Glasgow in Mechanical Engineering. For my thesis project, which I conducted at NTNU, I worked on computer vision assisted robotic welding for offshore platforms.

In my freetime you will most likely find me spending time outdoors hiking or mountain biking.
