I grew up between Germany and the UK and have also lived in Canada, Norway, and the United States. In my freetime you will most likely find me outdoors hiking, running or cycling.

My professional expertise lies at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning and robotics, where I am driven by challenges with a positive impact on society.

Over the past 5 years, I have addressed challenges in climate tech, mobile robotics and health tech, with my work actively running on dozens of systems in real-world environments.

Currently, I am developing deep learning methods to build a medical digital twin of the human patient.

You can find more detail in my CV.
