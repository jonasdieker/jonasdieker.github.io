My research/work interests lie broadly in perception and robotics.

I recently completed master's thesis for my degree at TU Munich in Robotics & AI.

The research of my thesis was about generative models for simulation of ocean currents and was conducted at UC Berkeley.

Prior to this I received a masters degree from the University of Glasgow in Mechanical Engineering.
