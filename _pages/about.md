My primary professional interests lie broadly in computer vision and robotics. I have previous experience in generative models, computer vision and robotics (autonomous driving and industrial automation). Currently I am looking for full-time challenges in Data Science and Machine Learning in Europe. If you think we might be a good fit feel free to reach out to me!

I recently completed an M.Sc. in Robotics & AI from TU Munich. For my master's thesis, which I conducted at UC Berkeley, I researched learning generative models from sparse data.

Prior to this I received an M.Eng. from the University of Glasgow in Mechanical Engineering. For my thesis project, which I conducted at NTNU, I worked on computer vision assisted robotic welding for offshore platforms.

In my freetime you will most likely find me outdoors hiking or mountain biking.
